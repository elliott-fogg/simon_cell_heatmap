Toggle for having start of firing aligned for each cell, or not
Allow for taking a difference for each cell between a before and after case (e.g. applying a drug)

Ways of sorting the data:
* Size / capacitance
* Arbitrary custom fields, depending on number of cell attributes before the dual-column split
