# Simon's Heatmap Generator for [STUFF]

(Simon, please do this part, this is just a placeholder explanation for now)
This Heatmap Generator is used for comparing electrophys readings in a standardized way.

# Formatting Data
1) 	Each excel file can have multiple sheets in it. All sheets should have the
	same format, and the names of the sheets are how they will be selected in 
	the software.

2) 	Each sheet should be divided up into 2 parts, top and bottom. The top part
	has the identifying and sorting information for each cell (see part 3 & 4),
	while the bottom part has the electrophys data for each reading (see
	part 5). If in doubt at any point, see the Sample Data for an example of 
	how the input data should be laid out.

3)	Identifying Information - The first column (Column A) should contain the 
	labels for each row of this section. The actual names do not particularly 
	matter, but as a suggestion the first might be 'Date', and the second might 
	be 'Cell No' (as in the example data). Together, these two rows form a 
	unique identifier for each cell. While the actual values in these rows are 
	not actually important, it should be ensured that each cell has a unique 
	combination of values, and that the same cell in other sheets has an 
	identical pair of values, to make sure that they can be matched for the 
	Difference Heatmap. Also, due to the way in which the electrophys data is 
	laid out, each the identification/sort data for each cell should have one 
	empty column space in between them (so the first cell identifying data would
	be in Column B, and the second would be in Column D, etc.)

4)	Sorting Information - Immediately below the Identifying Information, you can 
	include as many rows as desired (or none, if you like) of Sorting 
	Information. This can include data like the capacitance or resistance of
	each cell. The values do not need to be identical for each cell between 
	sheets - There is an option to choose the value from a specific sheet to 
	sort by.
	Below the Sorting Information, there should be a single empty row, to denote 
	the separation between the Sorting Information and the Electrophys Data
	below.

5)	Electrophys Data - The electrophys data should be recorded in pairs of 
	columns for each cell, with the left-hand column of each pair containing the 
	Current recorded for that spike, and the right-hand column of each pair 
	containing the recorded Frequency of the spike. The first entry for each 
	cell should be the starting Current (used for normalisation), with a 
	corresponding N/A value for the Frequency. 
	To align with the Identifying Information, the first column (Column A) 
	should be left empty, and all data should be recorded from Column B onwards.
	When a the recordings for a given cell have finished, there is no need to 
	fill in the remaining rows with empty data - just leave them blank and they
	will be interpreted correctly.

If in any doubts about the instructions, please refer to the Sample Data 
available on the website, and attempt to copy the format.
